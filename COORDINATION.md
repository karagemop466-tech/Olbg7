## Log
- 2026-10-26: Session 610d0099 claimed tasks 1-5 on arena/610d0099-olbg7. No other sessions/branches found (`git branch -a` shows only main + this branch). Sandbox bash has no direct OLBG access (allowlist only); research via web search/fetch of official league/tournament sources.
- Known gaps at claim time: PDC Players Championship 31/32 draws made on the day (no match fixtures yet); UK greyhound racecards (trap draws/runners) not yet published for 27 Oct meetings; Gaelic county representatives for some provincial ties not yet decided. These will be flagged, not filled in.
- 2026-10-26: Tasks 2-4 done by 610d0099 (sole session, acting as integrator). 75 rows built via tools/build_site.py -> docs/ (18 pages, no internal broken links). All predictions 39-50 words; banned words (model/verified) removed from prediction text. 18 High, rest Medium/Low; 7 no-selection rows (5 greyhounds + 2 Gaelic) + 15 caution notes = 22 flagged rows on docs/flagged.html.
- Irregularities flagged: PC31/32 draws on the day; UK greyhound runners/traps unpublished 27 Oct; Gaelic Down/Tyrone + Munster SFC county reps undecided; World Series G4 pitchers unpublished; Mensik R1 opponent is an unnamed qualifier; tri-series finalists TBC; Tonga/Samoa + Lisbellaw/Eoghan Ruadh form not confirmed (Low only).
- Pages note: `gh api .../pages` shows the site is already enabled as legacy source `main` + `/` (root), html_url https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg7/ . API create/update returned 403 (token cannot change Pages source), so a root `index.html` redirect to `docs/` was added instead — do not change the Pages source; the live entry point is the repo root redirecting into `docs/`.

## Parallel-session handoff — 2026-10-26T20:34Z
- Session `arena/38b0cb31-olbg7` started from commit `a28d3ac` while session `610d0099` had already merged PR #1 into `main`. It cannot use a separate `session-<id>/<task>` branch because Arena fixes it to `arena/38b0cb31-olbg7`.
- Conflict resolution: both `COORDINATION.md` boards are preserved above; no work from session `610d0099` was discarded. `arena/38b0cb31-olbg7` takes over only Task 5 (verification, corrections, link/build checks, Pages deployment confirmation, and a follow-up PR/merge). It will not duplicate Tasks 1–4.
- Scope for `arena/38b0cb31-olbg7`: `COORDINATION.md`, `data/picks.json`, `tools/build_site.py`, `docs/**`, `index.html`, `.nojekyll` as needed for verification and fixes. Any competing session should claim new tasks here before editing those files.
- Merge-conflict disposition: add/add conflict in `COORDINATION.md` during `git rebase origin/main`. Resolved by keeping the completed work log from `main` and appending this handoff. No branch switch or force push was used.
